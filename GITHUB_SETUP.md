# üöÄ GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create your GitHub repository and push your code:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `Dashboard-MTP` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Real-time analytics dashboard for Mileage Tracker Pro - Monitor user activity, revenue, growth metrics, and retention"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. 
Run these commands in your terminal (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Dashboard-MTP.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/Dashboard-MTP.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files except `.env` (which is properly ignored)
3. The README.md should be displayed on the main page

## Step 4: Add Repository Topics (Optional)

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the gear icon next to "About"

   - `streamlit`
   - `supabase`
   - `dashboard`
   - `analytics`
   - `python`
   - `postgresql`
   - `data-visualization`
   - `plotly`

   - **Issues** - for bug tracking
   - **Discussions** - for Q&A
   - **Projects** - for task management
   - **Wiki** - for documentation

## Step 6: Add Secrets for GitHub Actions (Optional)

If you plan to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add repository secrets:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`

## Step 7: Create Initial Release (Optional)

1. Go to Releases ‚Üí Create a new release
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: "Initial Release - Mileage Tracker Pro Dashboard"
4. Describe the features
5. Publish release

## üìù Important Notes

- The `.env` file is NOT included in the repository for security
- Users will need to create their own `.env` file using `env.example` as a template
- Make sure to never commit sensitive credentials to the repository
- Consider using GitHub Secrets for any automated deployments

## üîí Security Reminders

- Never commit `.env` files
- Rotate your Supabase keys periodically
